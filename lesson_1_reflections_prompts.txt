    The history show you how you think about the project and how you torn the project better.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    The process manually are more dificil and you can esquecer. But automatically process criam big and unlogicall commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
